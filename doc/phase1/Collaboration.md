##Schedule Conflicts

We chose Wednesdays to meet at Bahen Centre, it is the best day for all of us.

##Meetings
The first team meeting occurred on [January 27](../../meetings/Jan27.md), with all team members in attendance. (1 hr 30 mins)
The second team meeting occurred on [February 3](../../meetings/Feb3.md), with all team members in attendance. (2 hr)

Conclusions and meetings' durations are in the [meetings directory](../../meetings).

## Project Idea
During the first meeting, all members brought up their ideas. Each idea was discussed, and tested for the three main questions.
At the end of the meeting, a vote was taken selecting the web browser extension idea, with the understanding that final selection would only be confirmed after receiving feedback from our TA.

##Collaborative Work

We all need to make some research about browser function(Backhand, API etc.) and private info leaks because they are the key point for our project.
We voted for every decision we made during the meetings and we will keep voting for the subjects we need to.

Pros:
We are very good at communication, we decided to communicate on Slack, we set up Google Calendar and merged it with Slack for the meetings' dates, times and location.
All of us are contributing.
We are building the ideas together in a good discussion environment. We are also good at using Github. We commit everything we see they are necessary to make the others see.

Cons:
We are still working on being more productive. It is too early to say that we are bad at something.
