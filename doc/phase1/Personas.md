## Patty, the parent-on-facebook

Patty is in her late 40s, and primarily uses the internet to go on Facebook and
connect with her friends and family. She also does light browsing, reading 
articles posted to Facebook, as well as various news sites. 

Recently, Patty has become concerned with her health, and through the magic of
the internet, has begun to Google her symptoms. Her expectation in entering her
symptoms into a google search and visiting one of the myriad health-oriented
websites is that, since she is alone in her home, her search is between her and
Google--much like how discussions she has with her family doctor are considered
private.

To Patty's surprise, she eventually begins to see targetted ads relating to her
illness on Facebook. After installing our extension into her browser, her next
visit to her favorite illness website indicates that the Facebook "like" button
is linked to Facebook, and so Facebook knows that she is visiting this site. In
addition, she sees a large number of companies--many of which she has never 
heard of--similarly know about her browsing habits. 

The idea of strangers collecting information about her is disturbing to Patty. 
With the newfound understanding we have provided, she can now take steps towards
learning more, and potentially change her browsing habits to protect her privacy.

## Selma, the anti-adblock activist

Selma is in her 20s and works for an online news website. As her publication
does not charge subscription fees, its continued existence--and thus Selma's 
employment--depend on advertising revenue. As such, Selma makes a conscious 
decision to not use an adblocker when she browses the internet. 

Following a traumatic incident where Selma's friends make fun of her when an ad
pops up on the Youtube video they are watching on her computer, she gets into
and argument about internet advertising. Her employer touts itself as a 
responsible advertiser--they show ads in an [unobtrusive way](https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads#criteria).
Her friend, however, argues that even though her website may not appear malicious
in their presentation of ads, the very presence of ads allows a large quantity
of personal data to reach the databases of advertising and focus-group companies.

After installing the extension, Selma is disappointed to see that in addition
to the advertising on her employer's website that she supports, there are plenty
of third-party scripts that track her movement not only within her newspaper's
website, but also accross the internet at large. With this new information, she
is able to form a more nuanced opinion of online advertising, and thus participate
in the discussion in a more effective way.
