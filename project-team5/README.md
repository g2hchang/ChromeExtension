#The TrackerTracker


The TrackerTracker is a Google Chrome browser extension that teaches about private information leaks.

The target users are high school students. It is to be used in a classroom to teach them that web surfing is not a private activity and they are being tracked all the time. We chose the highschool students as a target because:
 - They do a lot of web browsing
 - They use social media sites
 - They are more susceptible to advertising

###Why?

Their browsing habits are giving social media and advertising companies (such as DoubleClick by Google etc.) the information they need in order to serve targetted to the teens.

###Further Details:
####We have a lesson plan and statistics page:
