# Feb. 17th meeting
- Angel is the scrum master!
- read over the Personas md file to get a clear sense of who we're building this for
- talk about personal data thats being leaked and digital fingerprinting
- start writing issues and prioritizing them (ones we're working on now and ones to put in the backlog)
- Priorities: small = 1-2 hours (fix some bugs, small changes), medium = 2-5 hours (know what to do and how to do it, but have to add new functioanlity), high = 5+ hours (don't know how to do something, need to research)
- choose tasks to work on during this iterator, and assign these tasks to team members
