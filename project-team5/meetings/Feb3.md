# Feb. 3

## Updates
- we met with our TA, got our idea approved
- figured out more details about specifics (now the extension is for Chrome rather than Firefox)
- we set up Slack integration with GitHub


## Todays meeting

- trying to figure out how to split up the work: each of us writes one bullet point from the requirements
- also figuring out what extra material we can add to the repo
- take into account Spandans suggestions about the users and use cases
- Marc: scholarly articles about privacy and how users are in the dark about it
- Doga: businesses could be the users of it as well
- we collabratively wrote the .md files needed for phase 1
- slight problem: a few commits Adam made (username slideon on GitHub) were actually made by Angel and Albert on Adams computer -- git used slideon as the username instead of their git usernames
