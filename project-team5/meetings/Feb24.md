# Feb. 24 - Meeting w/ Spandan
- phase 4 - story and motivation needs to be polished at that point, how we're going to sell our idea
- demo: don't assume that Spandan knows our project very well, walk him through what it is and how it works, its only a 5 min demo, its like presenting the idea to someone who doesn't know what it is, they're seeing it for the first time
- discussion & justification is important on the technical side, explain why you used a certain framework, language, etc. in technical terms
- explain why we choosed the stories and issues to work on in this iteration
- focus on what we have achieved rather than what we're going to achieve in the future
- choose the most appropriate way to present the information (table, paragraphs, diagrams, burndown chart, etc. were appropriate), instead of large paragraphs 
- main problem w/ phase 1 was the lack of the focus on the motivation/story
- gave a recap to Spandan about where we are on the technical side of things, what we've done so far
- UI isn't super important now, more important later (UI is the first point of contact when someone uses it), spread out the work across the different areas, don't go overboard w/ the UI, add functionality too
- meet again on Friday w/ Spandan, hopefully have a rough demo by then
- communication problems: one issue we'll have to overcome
