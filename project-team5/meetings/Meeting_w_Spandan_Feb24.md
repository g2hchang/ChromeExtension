##COMMENTS:

In the next demo: donâ€™t assume that the audience (TA) is familiar with the app background, so prepare a proper introduction
	-give rationale for decisions
	-focus on what did happen and got done
	-look for opportunities to present info other than text

From phase 1: biggest issue was the inadequacy of motivating story
	-can change it before phase 4 demo

We were encouraged to have substance to go with the glitz

Spandam was happy to hear about our paired coding responsibilities

We should consider breaking down some of the large tasks
	-there are lots of them
	-and to tighten up the task rating system
