# Feb. 10 Meeting - 2 hours
- hasing out details about what we are planning to build, smoothing over details in the .md files
- Allan: concerns about how broad the userbase is, try to make the user more specific
- technical details: analyze Ajax calls, cookies (+ other client-side storage), message headers, client-side scripts
- Marc: showing number of cookies and scripts could be a good starting point (overlay on top of the page)
- we still need to figure out exactly how the UI will look (Marc suggested an overlay overtop the HTML)
- we looked at the cookies on a typcial website - 3rd webistes interact w/ the cookies stored on an unrelated website, unique user ids are also stored
- made some edits to the summary content as well - clarified certain things
- Allan: we should only have one persona
- we planned out the basic design - what classes we're going to use, MVP, basic UML diagrams
- for next week: experiment w/ the Chrome API, maybe start coding more concerte classes/methods
